If you aren’t familiar with the concept of informational interviews, I am about to let you in on a bit of a job-search secret. Many young professionals, unfortunately, either forget to include informational interviews in their career-search tool kit or are too intimidated to initiate the process of setting up informational interviews. This is a shame because informational interviews can be a super powerful job-search and networking tool. ​
What is an informational interview? ​
An informational interview is an informal meeting or conversation set up between you and an industry professional currently working a job or within a company that is of interest to you. It is an opportunity to better understand the industry, job type, company, or career path you are interested in pursuing. Informational interviews are not job interviews, nor should they be used to find job openings. The goal of them is to learn, begin forming relationships, and feel out whether you’d be a good fit for the company or industry that you’re interested in. ​
Why conduct an informational interview? ​
To get a better understanding of the types of jobs and/or companies you are interested in applying to work with. 
Get up-to-date, relevant information about the day-to-day realities of different fields, industries, or positions.
Gain firsthand insight into the workings of your industry or company of interest, potentially including their projected hiring expectations/schedule. 
Feel out the culture and work-life experience you’d get in a particular industry or position.
Learn about career paths and trajectories you may not have considered.
Be inspired by the career journey of the professional you get to connect with. 
Establish professional relationships within your industry or company of interest.
Expand your network! Connect with people who may forward job leads and openings to you in the future.
