I grew up in Maine, by the ocean, with one younger sister. My parents are divorced but live 20 minutes from one another, so much of my childhood was spent commuting. I grew up with a litany of health problems, likely exacerbated by the fairly traumatic divorce experience. 

I originally came to Vermont to attend the University of Vermont, where I majored in neuroscience for two years before transferring to Champlain Online. I am still interested in neuroscience, but not medical school, and UVM became too expensive for me. Even pre-COVID, I was also getting sick repeatedly and getting pneumonia frequently while living on campus. Through Champlain, I am earning my B.S. in Intregrated Studies with three certificates: digital marketing, project management, orgizational development and HR.

I am living in Winooski, VT and am keeping my professional options open. I'm currently doing marketing and admistrative work for Evolution Physical Therapy and Yoga. I am responsible for social media marketing, promotional content, and campaign planning for the business. Additioanlly, I am a Peer Career Coach with Champlain's Career Collaborative--helping other students prepare for their job search, find jobs and interships, and apply successfully.
